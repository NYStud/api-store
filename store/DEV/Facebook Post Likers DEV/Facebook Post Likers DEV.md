# Get highly qualified active Facebook members
Wether you have found a post or have your own post that is creating engagement within the community you're targeting, this tool will help you scrape info about all the likers (name, Facebook Profile URL).

# What will you need? ⚙️ 

- **Session cookies c\_user and xs**: Your _c\_user_ and _xs_ session cookies from Facebook.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with Facebook post URLs in it, OR the direct link of a single Facebook post. To get the URL of a Facebook post, just click on its timestamp.

_(**You already have all that?** Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_


# What you need to do.

## 4. Facebook authentication 🔑 { argument }
Because the script will manipulate Facebook for you, it needs to be logged on your Facebook account. For that you just need to copy paste two session cookies in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your Facebook homepage and open the inspector  
→ Right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)  
→ <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS  
or  
→ <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the “Application” tab

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet 📑
Below your session cookies you’ll find Spreadsheet URL.

Add in the Spreadsheet URL textbox the link of a Google spreadsheet with this same format **(Share option must be OPEN)**.

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Facebook Post URLs (**one link per row**).

You can specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.
You can also enter a single Facebook post URL directly in the field.
